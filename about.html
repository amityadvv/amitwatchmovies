<h2>Amit Yadav</h2>
<h3>
Hello! I am Amit Yadav, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from AKTU. I have a keen interest in software development and am passionate about learning new technologies. My goal is to leverage my skills to contribute to innovative projects and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am working on an exciting project called 'Health Center'. This app aims to assist people suffering from various diseases, especially those who are hesitant to seek timely treatment. The app addresses key issues such as finding authentic doctors, symptom recording, community communication, medicine delivery, chatbots, government schemes, hospital informatio.

I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or just to say hello!</h3>
